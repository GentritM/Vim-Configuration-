# Vim-Configuration-
My personal Vim configuration for Python, Django, Flask, Html-Css-JavaScript, Jinja etc...)

How it works?

Copy the content of vimrc and paste it to your .vimrc file if you already have a .vimrc file, 
if not then create it on your home directory and paste the content of vimrc from this repo.

After that, Vundle will be installed automatiaclly.

Vundle is a package manager for Vim that helps you install and manage vim plugins.

How to use it?
Check some videos on Youtube on how to use Vundle
This one made by MinuteVimTricks helps a bunch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55QoaJpOjg

Inside the Plugins file there are some plugins that I have installed.

This combination makes it perfect to configurate Vim for Python, Django, Flask, Html-Css-JavaScript, Jinja etc...

Note:
Inside the Vimrc there are some personal key configurations that makes it easier to work, for example <F9> key runs python files,
Control J switches to next buffer, ALT-Arrows switches between tabs etc...
